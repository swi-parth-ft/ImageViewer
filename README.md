# ImageViewer
## This is simple iOS application in which you can...
- user can download any image from URL and store, and user can see all the images in Main view controller which is our home screen, and user can scroll using picker.
- user also can select any image from local library and store in array.
- user can take a photo from camera and store as well

I have build this project using xcode, swift and storyboard for designing.
